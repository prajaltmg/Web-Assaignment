                It was a very interesting and joyful learning web development. I was a beginner while joining this course I was nervous too because the senior batch of mine told me that it is a hard course, but it was different in my case it was medium level hard for me neither too hard nor too easy. At first, the teacher taught using GitHub which was very cool because cmd was needed for the push and pull process. First, I learn how to go in and out of a directory, and later I learn how to create a repo and push our website, files, etc. on Github. After GitHub, we begin our major part which is web development. At first, our teacher taught about the basic HTML structure. After HTML structure teacher taught us basic CSS. After that, I know that CSS is used for designing and editing HTML elements and content. After this, I know how to use alt tags and link HTML with CSS. Then I learn how to create a webpage using positioning properties such as position, float, display, and flex. It was very fun learning this property because it makes our work easier while positioning the elements. After positioning properties I learned about the responsive webpage and this topic was hard for me. we have to make out webpage compatible with mobile devices too. After that, I learned about material design like transition and animation. This was an interesting part because this design helps our website to look more attractive. After that, I learned about css3 properties like background, border, 2D & 3D animation, text effect, etc. After that, I learned about forms which were easy for me because the tag was easy to understand. At last, I learned about the grid layout which was very useful while creating a website. This grid layout helps to make the layout of our webpage and put the content according to our design. This was my journey of term 1 or Basic HTML learning.
